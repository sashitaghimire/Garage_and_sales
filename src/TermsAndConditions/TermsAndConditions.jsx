              <div>
                The Garage and Yard Sale Services allow you to post items for
                sale by uploading pictures and providing item descriptions. You
                can post most items through the Services without charge. Garage
                and Yard Sale charges a fee to post some items, for example, if
                you exceed your available free posts for certain types of items
                in certain categories. For more information on how and when fees
                are charged, see below.

              <br />
              <div>
                When a buyer and seller agree on a price for an item posted for
                sale on the Services there are several options for completing
                the transaction.
              </div>
              <br />
              <div>
                If a buyer and seller agree, items may be paid for in-person and
                outside of the Garage and Yard Sale Services, such as by cash,
                check or other agreed upon payment methods. The details of such
                a transaction and their payments are made directly between the
                buyer and the seller when they complete their transaction,
                pursuant to terms they determine. Garage and Yard Sale is not a
                party to such transactions in any way, does not facilitate such
                transactions, and cannot assist with refunds or returns related
                to such transactions in any manner. Since Garage and Yard Sale
                is not a party or involved in transactions of this nature, you

                States. You may not post any job openings that violate the
                Garage and Yard Sale Prohibited Items and Jobs Guidelines.

                Garage and Yard Sale permits sellers to post certain items as
                being available for shipping nationwide (within the contiguous
                United States). Items purchased via Shipping require a user to
                pay for the purchase with a credit card or other electronic
                payment method through the Services ("Garage and Yard Sale
                Payment Solution"). All purchases made using the Garage and Yard
                Sale Payment Solution are made directly between you and the
                other party according to these Terms and any other terms the
                parties mutually determine. Garage and Yard Sale is not a party
                to such transactions and disclaims any and all responsibility to
                facilitate such transactions or provide refunds or returns,

                Sellers who post items as being available for shipping
                nationwide must ship their items in accordance with Garage and

                Policy, Packaging Policy, and 2-Day Purchase Protection Policy.
                Sellers who receive a prepaid shipping label are charged a fee
                for sales that results in an item being shipped. The seller may
                cancel an accepted offer up until the package is initially
                scanned for mailing by our authorized shipping partner.

                Buyers who have requested items be shipped to them pay for the
                cost of shipping items. When a seller accepts a buyer's offer to
                purchase an item and have it shipped to them, Garage and Yard
                Sale will charge or put a hold on the buyer's method of payment,
                pending delivery of the item. Buyers can cancel an offer to
                purchase an item for shipping up until the seller has accepted
                the offer.

                the Shipping Policy. Garage and Yard Sale is not liable for any
                losses, damages, or delays related to shipping and users ship

                Solution, you authorize Stripe to share your payment method

              <div className="pl-2">
                a. General. While using Garage and Yard Sale is generally free,
                some products or services may be available for a fee (the "Paid
                Services"). Paid Services include, but are not limited to, the
                following: (i) the ability to pay for more or certain types of
                item posts within the Garage and Yard Sale marketplace, (ii) the
                ability to promote your posted item more prominently in the
                Services, (iii) the ability to purchase certain enhanced account
                features, (iv) the ability to post a Job, or (v) other services
                or features Garage and Yard Sale may develop. Unless otherwise
                noted, Paid Services are charged, billed, and managed through
                your applicable Apple App Store or Google Play Store platform
                (each a "Platform"). Some Paid Services are one-time payments,
                and some Paid Services are subscriptions that will renew
                according to the terms identified at the time of purchase.

                of posts, promotions or Services a month or a year, and that
                renew either monthly or yearly, are subscriptions (a
                "Subscription"). The renewal period is based on the Subscription
                you select, and the frequency of renewal will be clearly
                identified at the time of purchase. After you purchase a
                Subscription, your Platform will automatically charge you the
                fee for the first time period and the Platform's payment terms
                will apply (please review your Platform's payment and
                subscription terms for additional information on how their
                processes are managed). Unless otherwise stated, a Subscription
                will automatically renew and continue for the same price, Paid
                Service, and term length until you or the Platform cancel your
                Subscription, or Garage and Yard Sale no longer offers the
                Subscription.

                c. Cancellation. There is no obligation to continue a
                Subscription, and you can cancel at any time prior to the end of
                the renewal of the current Subscription period. To cancel a
                Subscription, locate the cancel settings in your Platform at
                least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. If you
                don't cancel within 24 hours before the end of the current
                period, payment for the next renewal period's subscription fees
                will be automatically charged through your Platform's payment
                method and you will have renewed for another renewal term; your
                Subscription will be canceled after the additional renewal term.

                Garage and Yard Sale allows you to apply for certain badges that
                are associated with your Garage and Yard Sale account. One badge
                we offer is the TruYou badge. The TruYou badge is given to users

                personal identification document that you provide to us is an
                unaltered and accurate image of your government-issued personal

                    sending a written notice of your claim ("Notice") to Garage
                    and Yard Sale by email at both support@  and legal@, or by
                    certified mail addressed to Garage and Yard Sale Inc., Attn:

                    The Notice must (a) include your name, your residence
                    address, your email address, your telephone number, and, if
                    you have registered for an Garage and Yard Sale account, the
                    email address your account is registered under if it is
                    different from your current email address; (b) your Garage
                    and Yard Sale account username; (c) a description of the
                    nature and basis of the claim; (d) details on the specific
                    Garage and Yard Sale item or transaction in question; and
                    (e) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you
                    will be similar in form to that described above. If you and
                    Garage and Yard Sale cannot reach an agreement to resolve
                    the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is
                    received, then either party may submit the dispute to
                    binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the
                    limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All
                    disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through
                    confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator.
                    Arbitration proceedings will be held in King County,
                    Washington unless you are a consumer, in which case you may
                    elect to hold the arbitration at the JAMS office closest to
                    your residence. For purposes of this Section 21, a
                    "consumer" means a person using the Services for personal,
                    family or household purposes. Additionally, arbitrations may
                    be conducted telephonically or via video conference for
                    disputes alleging damages less than $10,000. You and Garage
                    and Yard Sale agree that arbitrations will be held in
                    accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
                    Procedures ("JAMS Rules"), including without limitation,
                    provisions regarding consolidation of claims. The most
                    recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS
                    website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either
                    acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the
                    JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules
                    and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should
                    not apply for any reason.

                    You and Garage and Yard Sale agree that these Terms affect
                    interstate commerce, that the enforceability of this Section
                    21 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the
                    Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the "FAA"),
                    and that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
                    the FAA shall preempt application of state laws regarding
                    arbitration, including without limitation, provisions of the
                    California Arbitration Act. As limited by the FAA, these
                    Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive
                    authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions
                    regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would
                    otherwise be available in court, including the power to
                    determine whether a dispute may be arbitrated. The
                    arbitrator may not preside over any type of class or
                    representative proceeding, however, in the event that five
                    or more claims in arbitration are initiated which assert the
                    same or similar factual allegations, or raise the same or
                    similar legal issues, we may request that the claims be
                    consolidated for resolution consistent with Rule 6 of the
                    Streamlined Rules, and you agree to consolidation of your
                    claim with the claims of other claimants asserting the same
                    or similar factual allegations, or whose claims raise the
                    same or similar legal issues. In such a consolidated
                    proceeding, a single arbitrator shall be appointed to
                    resolve all consolidated claims, who shall resolve common
                    issues of law and fact and apply such rulings consistently
                    to the consolidated claims.

                    The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of
                    non-privileged information relevant to the dispute. The
                    arbitrator, Garage and Yard Sale, and you will maintain the
                    confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments
                    and awards, including, but not limited to, all information
                    gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the
                    arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The
                    arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate
                    rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law
                    provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does
                    not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to
                    prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the
                    merits, in connection with a court application for a
                    preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial
                    challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to
                    the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or

                    any arbitration initiated by Garage and Yard Sale, Garage
                    and Yard Sale will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and
                    Garage and Yard Sale agree that the state or federal courts
                    of the State of Washington and the United States sitting in
                    King County, Washington have exclusive jurisdiction over any

                    claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred,

                    If any portion of this Section 21 is found to be
                    unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the
                    unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from
                    these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful
                    provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder
                    of this Section 21 or the parties' ability to compel
                    arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis
                    pursuant to this Section 21; and (c) to the extent that any
                    claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective,
                    consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be
                    litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not
                    in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of
                    those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any
                    individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of
                    this Section 21 is found to prohibit an individual claim
                    seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have
                    no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought
                    out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 21
                    will be enforceable. If you are a consumer, the provisions
                    of this Section 21 will be modified to the extent necessary
                    to conform to the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum
                    Standards.
